# 100 Days of Learning Python
## Foreword

This repo is all about the Python Course on Udemy from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/"> 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022 </a> - Angela Yu

From my point of view, this course is great, but not my study style. The information is spread out in the whole course.

Target:
- I use this course to calculate how much time do i need to jump right a source code and modify, improve it with something new.
- Then a quick review to the thing I learn about coding Python.
- Considering these projects as my personal projects.
